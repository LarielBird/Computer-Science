# Chapter 10: ArrayLists and Comparators

10.4  doubleList  
The doubleList takes a String arraylist and duplicates the elements in the list into a new one and outputs a string displaying the values.  

10.6  minToFront  
The method accepts an integer arraylist and goes through it to find the minimum value, it then deletes it and adds it to the front.  

10.11 stutter  
Stutter acts similarly to doubleList except the method accepts a "k" value for how many times the elements in the arraylist should be duplicated.  

10.15 filterRange  
filterRange takes an Integer arrayList, min, and max integers. the method traverses through the arraylist comparing each number to see if its between the min and max. if its between that range, it deletes it off a duplicate arraylist.
