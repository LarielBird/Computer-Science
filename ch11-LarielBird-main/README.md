- 11.2 alternate
This method is a little janky and i dont want to mess with it but it has 2 iterators (i am aware i can rewrite it to only use one) it takes 2 lists of integers and makes a new list of both of the lists adding values from 1 then the other.
- 11.5 sortAndRemoveDuplicates
This method takes a list of integers and converts the list into a set to get rid of dupes and then sorts, it does not change the original data collection
- 11.9 hasOdd
This method takes a set of integers and checks the set to see if there are any odd numbers and returns true if there is.
- 11.16 is1to1
This method takes a HashMap of a key String and Value integer, it spits out a boolean whether or not it does not contain duplicate values.
