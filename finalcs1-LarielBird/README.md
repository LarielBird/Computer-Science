# FinalCS1

- My project is a simple program designed to figure out what to eat for a meal, it is a quiz that spits out  
an output based on the answers. I started with a small sample of options for testing so some quiz outcomes  
might not have a meal idea.  
- The program outputs the results to a text file to save the output.

- NO DEPENDENCIES  

- Using the program is self explanitory, you either type Yes or No, or y/n, they are not case sensitive and  
allows the user to reinput data if invalid.  

- The challange of this project was the comparision, it was tedious to manually put the food options in the program but 
had to be done if the program was to have a static amount of options that the user cannot add or remove. (which was
not the intention of this program)
